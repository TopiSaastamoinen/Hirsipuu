A GUINEA PIG
FIT AS A FIDDLE
A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ARE SOON PARTED
CUT THE MUSTARD
A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER
A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
DROPPING LIKE FLIES
YOU TALKING TO ME?
NO IFS, ANDS, OR BUTS
UNDER YOUR NOSE
KEEP ON TRUCKIN'
WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN
FISH OUT OF WATER
IN THE RED
PLAYING FOR KEEPS
IN A PICKLE
EASY AS PIE
BEATING A DEAD HORSE
A CUT ABOVE
CRY WOLF
UNDER THE WEATHER
WILD GOOSE CHASE
JAWS OF DEATH
AN ARM AND A LEG
CUP OF JOE
QUICK AND DIRTY
ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING
JACK OF ALL TRADES MASTER OF NONE
SWINGING FOR THE FENCES
TOP DRAWER
LOVEY DOVEY
SON OF A GUN
BURST YOUR BUBBLE
JAWS OF LIFE
MAN OF FEW WORDS
E.T. PHONE HOME
WHEN THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH
MOUTH-WATERING
IT'S NOT BRAIN SURGERY
KNOW THE ROPES
JIG IS UP
KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF
I'LL BE BACK
WOULDN'T HARM A FLY
A FEW SANDWICHES SHORT OF A PICNIC
HEAR, HEAR
QUICK ON THE DRAW
SHOT IN THE DARK
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT
LICKETY SPLIT
A LOT ON ONE’S PLATE
I WANT TO BE ALONE
PLAYING POSSUM
WHAT A DUMP
A LITTLE FROM COLUMN A, A LITTLE FROM COLUMN B
HASTA LA VISTA, BABY
WAKE UP CALL
RIGHT OFF THE BAT
TALK THE TALK
THEY'RE HERE
YADA YADA
READ 'EM AND WEEP
A COLD DAY IN JULY
FORGET IT, JAKE, IT'S CHINATOWN
CRY OVER SPILT MILK
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT
BREAK THE ICE
IT'S NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE, BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE
CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR
I SMELL A RAT
QUALITY TIME
HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM
I SEE DEAD PEOPLE
LUKE, I AM YOUR FATHER
ON CLOUD NINE
HEAD OVER HEELS
RAIN ON YOUR PARADE
SHORT END OF THE STICK
PUT A SOCK IN IT
HANDS DOWN
NO, I AM YOUR FATHER
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE
BAZINGA
EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING
A HOME BIRD
WOULDN'T HARM A FLY
MY CUP OF TEA
LONG IN THE TOOTH
A HAIR’S BREADTH
TUG OF WAR
LIKE FATHER LIKE SON
THERE'S NO I IN TEAM
DRAWING A BLANK
EAT MY HAT
LET HER RIP
A FEW SANDWICHES SHORT OF A PICNIC
OFF ONE'S BASE
NOT ONE SWALLOW MAKE SUMMER
SWEAT WHEN LAZY EATING, CHILLS WHILE WORKING
HAPPY AS A CLAM
DRIVE ME NUTS
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT, GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN
ALL GREEK TO ME
A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT
A BUSY BODY
OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, PLEASE, HAL.
WELL PLANNED IS HALF DONE
A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED.
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
A LONE WOLF
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH
A COLD FISH
BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
LIKE OFF THE SHELF OF A PHARMACY
ENDED AS SHORT AS A CHICKEN FLIGHT
BELIEF IS NOT WORTH KNOWING
GOOD ADVICE, BETTER HELP
A CUT BELOW
OUT OF THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE
SURELY FROST WILL DRIVE PIGLET TO HOME
FOOL'S GOLD
GOODY TWO-SHOES
NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
A HUNDRED AND TEN PERCENT
REPETITION IS THE MOTHER OF LEARNING
TWO FLIES WITH ONE PUNCH
GO OUT ON A LIMB
HIGH AND DRY
HEADS UP
HEAD AS A THIRD LEG
DON'T LICK BEFORE DROPPING
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH
GARBAGE TO GARBAGE
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE.
NO-BRAINER
A CAT NAP
GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY.
A DIME A DOZEN
RIDE HIM, COWBOY!
TOUGH IT OUT
